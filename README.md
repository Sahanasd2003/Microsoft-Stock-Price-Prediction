Microsoft Stock Price Prediction

Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task that requires analyzing historical data and market trends. This project aims to develop a deep learning model that predicts Microsoft's stock price based on historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 5,000 rows and 10 columns, including features such as historical stock prices, trading volume, and market indices.

Methodology
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and converting data to a suitable format for deep learning.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new features that capture relevant information.
3. Model selection: Comparing the performance of different deep learning architectures.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters using cross-validation and grid search.

Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 95.1% and a mean absolute error of 0.05. The most important features contributing to the prediction were historical stock prices, trading volume, and market indices.
